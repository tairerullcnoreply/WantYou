# WantYou
WantYou app is a website.
You can login or create an account and look up other users by full name or username

You can mark people as:
* Know you
* Want you
* Both

You can chose to make a Want You anonymous and the user you marked that way can chat with you, get to know you, and ask you to reveal who you are by making your Want You public.

- "This user knows you"
- "This user wants you"
- "This user both knows and wants you"

All of the above are headers a conversation, be it anonymous or not, have.

You can chat with others without being anonymous.
